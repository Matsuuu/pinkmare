# Pinkmare

PinkMare was born from the need of wanting something like Miramare but with a bit more standing out colors.

The aim of Pinkmare was to add a dash of bright red colors to the theme, while creating a bit more pastel experience

# Example

# Installation

```vim
Plug 'matsuuu/pinkmare'
```

# Usage

```vim
set termguicolors
colorscheme pinkmare
```

** Highly recommended to use [Vim Polyglot](https://github.com/sheerun/vim-polyglot) for syntax highlighting **

** PinkMare also supports [nvim-treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter) now!

# NOTE

Pinkmare has been kind of hacked together from the miramare theme, and isn't currently fully finished.
Some coloring changes might come along the way, as well as updating the colors profiles to match the new settings.

Current tested environments are Javascript and Java (to an extent at least).

Feel free to contribute to the development of Pinkmare
